# Eye-Controlled Mouse Interface

## Overview
This project implements an eye-controlled mouse interface utilizing eye-tracking technology with `cv2` and `MediaPipe`, integrated with `PyAutoGUI` for seamless interaction. The interface aims to enhance accessibility for individuals with severe disabilities by providing an alternative input method.

## Features
- **Eye Tracking**: Utilizes `cv2` and `MediaPipe` for real-time eye tracking.
- **Mouse Control**: Integrates `PyAutoGUI` for controlling mouse movements and actions.
- **Accessibility**: Provides an alternative input method for individuals with severe disabilities.
- **Advanced AI**: Demonstrates advanced AI and programming skills to create impactful solutions that address real-world challenges.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Required Libraries
Install the required libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install pyautogui
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/eye-controlled-mouse.git
cd eye-controlled-mouse
```

2. Run the main script:
```sh
python eye_controlled_mouse.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the eye tracking.


    frame_h, frame_w, _ = frame.shape

   
## How It Works
1. **Eye Tracking**: The program uses `cv2` and `MediaPipe` to track eye movements in real-time.
2. **Mouse Control**: `PyAutoGUI` is used to map eye movements to mouse cursor movements and perform click actions.
3. **Calibration**: The user can calibrate the system to accurately detect and respond to their eye movements.
